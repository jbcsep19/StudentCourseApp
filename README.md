# StudentCourseApp

In a paired assignment, create an application that has at least two web pages:

All pages should have Bootstrap, a common navigation bar, and a footer.
The home page must have:
- a background image

The classes page must have:
- a 4-digit ID (ie. 0231)
- availability (open/closed)
- department ID (ie. Eng, Math, CS, etc)
- title
- description
- instructor name
- No. of credits

The classes page should have at least 5 entries, and use tables that has been adorned with Bootstrap.

The student page should have:
- a list of enrolled classes for three semesters, including the current semester
- a transcript
    - courses taken
    - grades
- and their overall GPA


Use Bootstrap and make it look good!
Using carousel, cards, and jumbotrons are recommended.
Submit one link for the group.
